## Team (solo)
- Ilya Kopyl (ikopyl@mail.sfsu.edu)


## Final Project proposal
### Description
An app that allows a user to play a platform (Mario-like) game with Pacman characters.

### Must have features
1.3. Game screen shall display a game character.
1.4. Game screen shall display a score.
1.5. Game screen shall render cherries that a game character can consume.
1.6. Game screen shall render ghosts that a game character must avoid.
1.7. Any time when a cherry is consumed by a game character, the score increments.
1.8. Any time when a game character collides with a ghost, the game is over.
1.9. When the game is over, the final score for the game is displayed.
1.9. When the game is over, the replay button appears, prompting user to try again.


### Nice to have features
2.1. As the game score increases, the speed of moving objects (cherries, ghosts) increases as well.
2.2. In order to make the rendereing pattern of the moving objects less predictable, leverage the randomization functions.
